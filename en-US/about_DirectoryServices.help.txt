SHORT DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell Module for Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) based on 
    .NET Namespace System.DirectoryServices.
LONG DESCRIPTION
    The cmdlets for the DirectoryServices PowerShell Module are for the most
    part built using the same cmdlet name-giving and parameter sets as the 
    Microsoft ActiveDirectory PowerShell Module. The difference is that 
    while the ActiveDirectory module is dependant on Active Directory Web
    Services, the DirectoryServices module is built around the
    System.DirectoryServices namespace in the .NET Framework, which uses
    LDAP to communicate with Active Directory as well as other Directory
    Services.
